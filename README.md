Procedurallpapers
=================

A procedural wallpaper generator

I got this idea when generating nebulae for my SPACE game. I liked the design and liked removing the spaceships and solar systems and take screens to use as wallpapers. And so procedurallpapers was born.
Currently you can only make fractured wallpapers, I will be adding more algorithms every now and then. The next step is to implement a drop down menu so that you can choose which type of wallpaper to generate.


TO RUN:

1) Download the zip.

2) Open project and run.

3) Click the green 'fullscreen' button in the top left corner.

4) Cycle through (by clicking) until you find a decent looking wallpaper.

5) Hit [Cmnd + Shift + 3] to take a screenshot.

6) Rename the screenshot and save it somewhere.

7) Open System Preferences and change the wallpaper.

(5 - 7 not required, you can always just watch the magic of PCG)


THINGS TO ADD

• Drop down menu

• Fractal Wallpapers

• Perlin Noise Wallpapers

• In-App screenshots without having to go fullscreen
